 Diabetes Prediction:
This project demonstrates that machine learning models can predict diabetes with reasonable accuracy using health data features.
Among the models tested, Random Forest showed strong performance. Further improvements such as feature scaling, cross-validation, and detailed evaluation metrics could enhance the robustness of predictions. This forms a solid foundation for developing a more advanced and clinically useful diabetes prediction tool

Tools Used:  
•	Python libraries:
•	Pandas: for data loading, cleaning and manipulation.
•	Scikit-learn: for prioritization, training and modelling (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
•	Seaborn: for visualizing confusion matrices.
•	Matplotlib (optional): for additional plotting or visualization needs.
